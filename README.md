We use an object (accountBalances) to store account numbers as keys and their corresponding balances as values.
The user is prompted to enter their account number.
Based on the chosen action (check balance, withdraw, deposit, or exit), the appropriate logic is executed.
Feel free to customize and expand this code to add more features, error handling, and additional functionality.
